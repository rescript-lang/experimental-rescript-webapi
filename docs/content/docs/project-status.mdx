This project is highly experimental and subject to change.  
It is a work in progress and might not cover every API.  
The core idea is to prioritize ground coverage based on community needs.  
We aim to focus on the most used APIs first and then expand from there.

## Contributions

[Contributions](../01-getting-started) are welcome! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/rescript-lang/experimental-rescript-webapi/issues/new/choose) if you have a specific API you would like to see added.  
This really helps prioritize our work and ensures that the most important APIs are addressed first.

## Current Status

All bindings were generated using a modified version of [TypeScript-DOM-lib-generator](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-DOM-lib-generator).  
The next step is to manual tweak these files so they can enhance the developer experience.

## Future

Our goal is to make this a true community project. Consumers of the bindings should be able to contribute back to the project with minimal hassle.  
This means that the project should be easy to understand and contribute to. Once a contribution is accepted, a new release will follow shortly.
