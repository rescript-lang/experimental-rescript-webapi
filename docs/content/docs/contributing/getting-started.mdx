<Aside type="caution">
  **Real talk**: First time diving into this project? Might feel like a letdown.
  But hey, the upside? Itâ€™s stupid easy to toss us a PR and make it better!
</Aside>

The [WebAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) are vast and ever-growing. We need your help to make them better.  
There is no way our [contributors](https://github.com/rescript-lang/experimental-rescript-webapi/graphs/contributors) can cover everything.  
And that's where you come in! A small PR, focused on what you want to get out of this project can make a huge difference.

## Recommended workflow

We recommend the following overall workflow when developing for this repository:

- Fork this repository
- Always work in your fork
- Always keep your fork up to date

Before updating your fork, run this command:

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/rescript-lang/experimental-rescript-webapi.git
```

This will make management of multiple forks and your own work easier over time.

### Updating your fork

We recommend the following commands to update your fork:

```shell
git checkout main
git clean -xdf
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git push
```

Or more succinctly:

```shell
git checkout main && git clean -xdf && git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/main && git push
```

This will update your fork with the latest from `rescript-lang/experimental-rescript-webapi` on your machine and push those updates to your remote fork.

## Initial build

Install the dependencies and compile the bindings using `ReScript`:

```shell
npm install && npm run build
```
