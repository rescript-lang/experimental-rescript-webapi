The original bindings were generated using a modified version of [TypeScript-DOM-lib-generator](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-DOM-lib-generator).
These bindings were a great starting point, but they are not perfect.
It is more than likely that you will need to **tweak the generated bindings by hand** to make them more idiomatic to ReScript.

For example the `window.fetch` function was generated as:

```ReScript
/**
[Read more on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch)
*/
@send
external fetch: (window, ~input: request, ~init: requestInit=?)
  => Promise.t<response> = "fetch"

/**
[Read more on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch)
*/
@send
external fetch2: (window, ~input: string, ~init: requestInit=?)
  => Promise.t<response> = "fetch"
```

While not that bad and usable, it can be improved:

- Rename `fetch2` to `fetch` because it is the more common usage of the function.
- Rename `fetch` to `fetch_with_request` for clarity that this is the "overload" with a `Request` object.
- Consider removing the named `~input` and `~init` arguments and use positional arguments instead.
  Motivation: If the function does not have any parameters with the same type, it is more ergonomic to use positional arguments.
  This heuristic is not set in stone and can be adjusted based on the specific function.
- The documentation can be improved.

```ReScript
/** TODO: add better docs */
@send
external fetch: (window, string, ~init: requestInit=?)
  => Promise.t<response> = "fetch"

/** TODO: add better docs */
@send
external fetch_withRequest: (window, request, ~init: requestInit=?)
  => Promise.t<response> = "fetch"
```

Once these changes are made, the bindings can be tested and then committed to the repository.
The generation does no longer happen automatically, so manual improvements will not be overwritten.

## Sandboxed Code Generation

Not every API was covered by the TypeScript-DOM-lib-generator.  
Potentially, you want to add a new API to the bindings and star from code generation.

In [emitter.ts](https://github.com/rescript-lang/experimental-rescript-webapi/blob/main/tools/TypeScript-DOM-lib-generator/src/build/emitter.ts),
you can override the `interfaceHierarchy` with any new interface or type you want to add.

```typescript
interfaceHierarchy = [
  {
    name: "Temp",
    entries: [
      enums(["WebGLPowerPreference"]),
      dictionaries([
        "ImageBitmapRenderingContextSettings",
        "WebGLContextAttributes",
      ]),
    ],
    opens: [],
  },
];
```

After running the generator (in `tools/TypeScript-DOM-lib-generator`):

```shell
npm run build
```

All the generated files will be in the `tmp` folder. You can use this as inspiration for your own bindings.

To figure out if you need `enums`, `dictionaries`, or `interfaces`, you can look at the [JSON dump](https://github.com/rescript-lang/experimental-rescript-webapi/blob/main/tools/TypeScript-DOM-lib-generator/dom-dump.json) file
and see how the TypeScript-DOM-lib-generator represents the shape you are after.
