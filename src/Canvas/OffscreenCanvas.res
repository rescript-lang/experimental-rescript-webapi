Returns null if the canvas has already been initialized with another context type (e.g., trying to get a "2d" context after getting a "webgl" context).

Returns a promise that will fulfill with a new Blob object representing a file containing the image in the OffscreenCanvas object.

The argument, if provided, is a dictionary that controls the encoding options of the image file to be created. The type field specifies the file format and has a default value of "image/png"; that type is also used if the requested type isn't supported. If the image format supports variable quality (such as "image/jpeg"), then the quality field is a number in the range 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive indicating the desired quality level for the resulting image.
